# Leon-Website
Leon Filipiak's news website.
Make sure your url is: https://leonfilipiak.github.io/Leon-Website/newspage/homepage.html
Keep in mind that Github does not read files the same way as vs code, therefore you will not yet be able to navigate between pages through the navbar. This will be fixed in the future.
